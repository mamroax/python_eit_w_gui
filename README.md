# GUI based on pyEit project and customTkinter

## What is it for?
This project is used to make work with pyEIT more user-friendly for non-programers

## How to work with it?
To start a graphic user interface go to GUI and start "complicated_GUI.py". 
Consider installing all the libraries in "requirements.txt" first if it was not done automatically.
When app started do following steps:
1) Enter an integer number to average the measurement frames(a measurement frame is one complete impedance measurement between 16 electrodes) 
or leave blank space to default value of 1
2) Click a button "Calculate" to make a backward reconstruction. 
It will take some time for program to make it. Only GREIT method is working for now

The idea of entering a number to average the measurement is to get rid of the noise


## Used projects:
## - customTkinter
### Extended version of Tkinter library for making beautiful GUIs

## - pyEIT 
### A project with broad functionality in the field of EIT

## Who am i and what are my goals?
I'm a postgraduate electronics engineer student currently working on my phD.
Python projects are not the only  field of my interest, currently working on a project for 3D EIT reconstruction in java and 
a 2D reconstruction in C++
